firmware_150410_r1006
=====================

New mist.ini option allowing USB key codes to be replaced. E.g. if you want
to exchange the keys 'a' and 'b' on your keyboard you'd want to have the
USB HID keycodes 04 (the USB Usage ID of the key labeled 'a') and 05 
to be exchanged the mist.ini would look like:

[mist]
key_remap=04,05
key_remap=05,04

This makes key 04 to be reported as key 05 and vice versa.

The USB HID key codes (Usage ID) can be found in chapter 10 in
