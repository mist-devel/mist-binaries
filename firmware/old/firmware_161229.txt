firmware_161229
===============
- Added special support for Keyrah v2 (for those who would like to use Amiga 1200 case with US/UK keyboard):
  - Left side blank key is used as FN key.
  - Right side blank key is used as Right Ctrl.
  - LCtrl + LAmiga + RAmiga - For Amiga: reset, For 8bit cores: emulate right button on MiST Case (usually reset).
  - FN + LCtrl + LAmiga + RAmiga - Hard reset (load core.rbf).
  - FN + KP(, FN + KP) - switch mouse/joystick emulation.
  - FN + 1-9,0,-,=,\,[,],.,enter - emulate keypad for A600 keyboard.
  - FN + 1 - F11.
  - FN + 2 - F12.
  - FN + UP/DOWN - PageUp/PageDown.
  - FN + LEFT/RIGHT - Home/End.
  - FN pressed alone - OSD on/off key.
  - Due to Keyrah FW limitation, joystick and mouse emulation mapped to other keys.
    For joystick use KP8(Up), KP4(Left), KP6(Right), KP5/KP2(Down). Buttons: RCtrl, RShift, RAlt, RAmiga.
	For Mouse use use KP8(Up), KP4(Left), KP6(Right), KP5/KP2(Down). Buttons: KP7, KP9.
    Currently there is no convenient way to emulate Mouse/Joystick with A600 keyboard. Use real Mouse/Joystick 
	or switch Keyrah into alternative map when you want to use Mouse/Joystick emulation.
- Fixed Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock keys in Minimig core. Caps Lock LED is fixed as well.
- LShift + LCtrl + LAlt + RAlt - hard reset (load core.rbf) for all other keyboards.
- MiST will try hard reset if fatal error happened (no card inserted or no FAT partition found), so it will start automatically when proper SD card will be inserted.
- Added auto-repeat for LEFT/RIGHT keys in OSD for better file list navigation.
- Added FW update OSD dialog for Menu core (press ESC/F12/FN).
- Enable Keyboard LEDs (Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll Lock) control from FPGA.
