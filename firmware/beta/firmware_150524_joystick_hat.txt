firmware_150524_joystick_hat
----------------------------

This version adds support for the 'HAT' on USB joysticks. On gamepads this
is typically the default config for the digital direction pad. This is now
by default preferred over the analog axes which were used so far.

Many gamepads allow to switch between digital and analog mode and had
to be switched into digital mode to use the digital pad on the MIST. This 
should now be enabled by default.

You can always revert to the old behaviour by setting 

joystick_ignore_hat=1

in the mist.ini file.

Furthermore the new USB HID parser can be prevented from being used
for mice by using the following setting in mist.ini:

mouse_boot_mode=1

This reverts to the behaviour of firmware versions before 
firmware_150424_usbmouse and is supposed to be used with mice that stopped
working properly with the new parser. If you need to use this option please
get in touch with me and consider sending me this mouse for investigation.
