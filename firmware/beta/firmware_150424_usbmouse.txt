firmware_150424_usbmouse
------------------------

This experimental firmware does not switch USB mice into boot mode
anymore.

The main reason for this is the acorn archimedes which supports a third
mouse button while USB HID boot mode is limited to two mouse buttons.

This may also solve problems with mice that were behaving strange as
their boot mode implementation is broken. This is often the case with
keyboard/touchpad combo devices.

This update required some improvements in the generic USB HID parsers
and some joysticks which previously weren't working at all may also
benefit from this.
