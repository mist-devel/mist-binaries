64KB+512KB extended RAM (ram_test.dsk)
256 UpperROMs (files ending by .e00 to .eFF)

Amstrad CPC 6128 ROMs
LowerROM is still OS6128.ROM
BASIC1-1.e00 - UpperROM0
AMSDOS.e07   - UpperROM7

Assembler and text ROM :
Maxam.e01   - UpperROM1
Protext.e02 - UpperROM2

A Game ROM sample :
Light Force (UK) (Face A) (1986) [ROM].e03 - UpperROM3
Light Force (UK) (Face B) (1986) [ROM].e04 - UpperROM4

|MAXAM   for launching Maxam
|PROTEXT for launching Protext
|LIGHTFORCE  for launching Light Force

Remark : if I put Light Force in 0A and 0B instead of 03 and 04, Arkanoid does crash.

=========================2015-03-29=
I tested a few Games on the new Core.
In Core 150328R4, Protex prevents 3Dstarfighter from working, It freezes. Removing Protext.e02 fixes it. If Lightforce and Protext are on the Core, 3D Starfighter crashes.

Removing Maxam.e01 fixes Games with the Memory Full Error. Example Abracadabra.dsk.
I have to check now 689 Disks again if removing Maxam.e01 makes more games playable.

I let you know the Result.

r004 is moved to experimentals. It is more about "professional version".
r003.1 is the official current candidate, game oriented, ROMVault tested.
When a experimental version will unlock more games, it will became a candidate one.
