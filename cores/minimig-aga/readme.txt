Minimig-AGA for MIST (BETA)
---------------------------

This is a beta release of Rok Krajnc's AGA extension of the Minimig core.

This is a work in progress and many things will still need fixing. 

You'll need the latest firmware to run this.

Optionally put the three files minimig.art, minimig.bal and
minimig.cop into the SD cards root directory for a nice boot
animation.
